create an empty list called "tasks"

define a function "add_task" that takes in a task description and adds it to the "tasks" list

    check if task_index is valid (i.e. within the range of the "tasks" list)
        if not, print "Invalid task index" and return
    replace the task at task_index with new_task_description
    print "Task edited: ", new_task_description

define a function "delete_task" that takes in a task index and removes the task from the list
    input: task_index (int)
    output: none

    check if task_index is valid (i.e. within the range of the "tasks" list)
        if not, print "Invalid task index" and return
    remove the task at task_index from the "tasks" list
    print "Task deleted"

define a function "view_tasks" that prints all the tasks in the "tasks" list
